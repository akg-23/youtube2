# youtube2

I used SQL Postgres and Tableau to analysze the youtube data sets. 
Concentrated on youtube views from 7 different countries of American Football (NFL) related contentacross the different countries.
I used Unions to merge the 7 different datasets together, and only took data that was related to the NFL
The countries were;
United states,
Russia,
Mexico,
Canada,
U.K.
France,
Germany

Results:
The U.K had the most youtube views when it came up to the Superbowl
The United States at had about 70% of content that was uploaded with NFL content
Germany shown a steady viewership of NFL related content, and can potential be the next market for NFL to seek.
